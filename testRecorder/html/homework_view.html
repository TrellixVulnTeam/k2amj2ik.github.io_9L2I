Rapunzel Part 1


Rapun 001
This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel and it starts with the sun.

Rapun 002
Oh, you see that old woman over there? You might want to remember her. She's kind of important.

Rapun 003
The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen.

Rapun 004
And the Queen, she was about to have a baby. She got sick. Really, sick.

Rapun 005
She was running out of time, and that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.

Rapun 006
And all she had to do was sing a special song.

Rapun 007
Flower, gleam and glow Let your power shine Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine What once was mine

Rapun 008
For deep within the forest, in a hidden tower, Gothel raised the child as her own.

Rapun 009
Why can't I go outside? G: The outside world is a dangerous place, filled with horrible, selfish people.

Rapun 010
Well, I guess Pascal's not hiding out here...

Rapun 011
Yeah, I don't think so. I like it in here and so do you.

Rapun 012
Wow! I could get used to a view like this.

Rapun 013
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any younger down here.

Rapun 014
Uh, Rapunzel! How you manage to do that every single day without fail! It looks absolutely exhausting, darling.

Rapun 015
You know what I see? I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.

Rapun 016
I'm just teasing! Stop taking everything so seriously

Rapun 017
So, mother, earlier I was saying tomorrow's a pretty big day and you didn't really respond, so I'm just gonna tell you, it's my birthday! Tada!

Rapun 018
You know how I feel about the mumbling--blah-blah-blah-blah, it's very annoying, I'm just teasing, you're adorable, I love you so much, darling. Agh.

Rapun 019
Oh. Well, I was hoping you would take me to see the floating

Rapun 020
I need to see them, mother, and not just from my window. In person.



*7a.m. the usual morning line-up*
*Starting the chores I sweep 'til the floors all clean*
*Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up.*
*Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15.*
*So I'll read a book, or maybe two or three.*
*I'll  add a few new paintings to my gallery.*
*I'll play guitar, and  knit, and cook and basically.*
*Just wonder when will my life, begin.*
*Then after lunch, it's puzzles, and darts and baking.*
*Papier-m?h? a bit of ballet, and chess.*
*Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.*
*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.
Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.*
*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*
*And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush,
and brush my hair.*
*Stuck in the same place I've always been.*
*And I'll keep wondering, and wondering, and wondering...*
*Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.*
*Just like they do on my birthday, each year.*
*What is it like out there, where they glow?*
*Now that I'm older. Mother might just let me go.*






Rapunzel Part 2

Rapun 021
Don't ever ask to leave this tower again.

Rapun 022
Don't forget it, you'll regret it

Rapun 023
Well it's easy for you to say! You guys look amazing.

Rapun 024
I can't believe that after all we've been through together, you don't trust me?

Rapun 025
Sorry, my hands are full.

Rapun 026
Too weak to handle myself out there, huh, mother

Rapun 027
I bet my surprise is bigger!

Rapun 028
Well mother, there's something I want to tell you.

Rapun 029
You know I hate leaving you after a fight especially when I've done absolutely nothing wrong.

Rapun 030
I've been thinking a lot about what you've said earlier

Rapun 031
No, mother, I'm just saying, you think I'm not strong enough to handle myself out there.
Oh darling, I know you're not strong enough to handle yourself out there.

Rapun 032
Rapunzel, we're done talking about this--

Rapun 033
All I was gonna say, mother, is that, I know what I want for my birthday now.

Rapun 034
You're sure you'll be all right on your own?

Rapun 035
I know I'm safe as long as I'm here.
